# 1. Start with report-only mode in development
# 2. Use specific URLs instead of wildcards when possible
# 3. Avoid 'unsafe-inline' in production unless necessary
# 4. Set up CSP violation reporting to monitor issues
# 5. Test thoroughly before deploying to production
# 6. Verify your VITE_APP_URL is set correctly for your domain
